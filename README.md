1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. --> This is because running automated tests every time you push your code ensures that bugs are caught as soon as possible and you are able to get continuous feedback from your team throughout the whole development process. 

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
No. E2E tests are not designed to test individual functions/logic. You should use a unit test instead because they are more focused, are faster, and are easier to isolate and therefore debug.

3. What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?


4. Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
   1. Eliminate unused JavaScipt to reduce load time 
   2. Reduce the size of images to speed up loading 
   3. Improve the text/background contrast for better accessbility
